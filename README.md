# Excuse Generator

This is a simple web application that generates random excuses when you click a button.

## Files

- [app.js](app.js): This is the main JavaScript file that contains the logic for generating the excuses.
- [index.html](index.html): This is the HTML file that provides the structure of the web page.

## How to Use

1. Open [index.html](index.html) in your web browser.
2. Click the button on the page to generate a random excuse.

## Functionality

The `excuseGenerator` function in [app.js](app.js) generates a random excuse by combining elements from four different arrays: `who`, `action`, `what`, and `when`. The result is then injected into the webpage using the `textInjector` function.
